# Pig-Game
Pig is a simple dice game for 2  players. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points.

To play, each player takes turns rolling a single die. If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they score no points for that turn. 
If the player rolls any other number, they add that number to their score for the turn.
The player can continue rolling as many times as they like, but they risk rolling a 1 and losing all of their points for the turn.
When a player decides to stop rolling, they add their turn total to their total score. Play then passes to the next player. 
The game continues until one player reaches 100 points. That player wins the game.

Here are some tips for playing Pig:
1.Try to roll high numbers. The higher your roll, the more points you will score.
2.Be careful not to roll a 1. Rolling a 1 will end your turn and you will score no points for that turn.
3.Don't be afraid to stop rolling. If you are happy with your score, you can stop rolling and add it to your total score.

Pig is a fun and easy game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It is a great game for learning about probability and decision-making.
